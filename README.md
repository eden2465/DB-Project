# DB-Project
This project was part of database course, where we learned the core principles of database design and management. As part of the project, I modeled an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a website provided to my group, reflecting its real-world structure and relationships. Additionally, we wrote various complex business queries designed to model and extract meaningful business insights, addressing numerous operational and strategic needs. This project emphasized both theoretical and practical aspects of database systems, combining conceptual modeling with hands-on SQL query development.
